# FAT32 Library for 65C02

*by Frank van den Hoef, Michael Steil*

This is a generic and reusable FAT32 filesystem read/write library written in 65C02 assembly.

## Features

* read and write support
* long filenames
* subdirectories
* time stamps
* volume label
* file system creation
* SD card driver â€“ just add your own byte transmission code. e.g. [SPI for VIA 65c22](https://bitbucket.org/steckschwein/steckschwein-code/src/master/steckos/libsrc/spi/)
* detects swapping SD cards
* MBR partition table support
* multiple partitions mounted at the same time
* supports filesystems from 32 MB to 2 TB

## Missing Features

* there is no way to get the cwd string

## Requirements

* 65C02 CPU (could run on 6502 with help of [65c02inc](https://github.com/commanderx16/x16-rom/blob/68cec17c700bd9666dc49f801e0853af4e417ebf/cbdos/65c02.inc))
* about 8 KB of code space
* about 5 KB of RAM
* 8 bytes in the zero page

## API

Arguments and return data is passed in registers as well as following locations in memory:
* the `fat32_ptr`/`fat32_ptr2` zero page pointers, for zero-terminated paths.
* the `fat32_size` memory dword for sizes.
* the `fat32_dirent` structure for directory entries.
* `fat32_time_year`, `fat32_time_month`, `fat32_time_day`, `fat32_time_hours`, `fat32_time_minutes` and `fat32_time_seconds` for the current time, so the library can set file timestamps. (`fat32_time_year` is 1980-based.)

All paths use the Unix convention. `file.txt` specifies a file in the current directory, `subdir/file.txt` and `../file.txt` are relative paths, and `/subdir/file.txt` is an absolute path.

All API calls return C=1 for success and C=0 for error. If C=1, the `fat32_errno` global variable is set with the error code.

### Init

* `fat32_init`: Initialize library.

### Contexts

Most API calls require a context to be allocated and set. Contexts are associated with a partition. Partition numbers are 0-3 for the four primary MBR partitions. Partitions are mounted on demand.

* `fat32_alloc_context`: Allocate a context. Pass partition number in A. Returns context in A.
* `fat32_free_context`: Free a context. Pass context in A.
* `fat32_set_context`: Set current context. Pass context in A.
* `fat32_get_context`: Get current context. Returns context in A.

### File Contents

* `fat32_open`: Open existing file. Pass path in `fat32_ptr`.
* `fat32_create`: Create new file. Pass path in `fat32_ptr`, C=1 to overwrite.
* `fat32_close`: Close open file. The timestamp will be updated from `fat32_time_year` etc.
* `fat32_read`: Read from file. Pass pointer in `fat32_ptr`, size in `fat32_size`. Returns bytes read in `fat32_size`.
* `fat32_write`: Write to file. Pass pointer in `fat32_ptr`, size in `fat32_size`.
* `fat32_read_byte`: Read a byte from open file. Returns byte in A.
* `fat32_write_byte`: Write a byte to open file. Pass byte in A.
* `fat32_get_offset`: Get current offset in file. Returns value in `fat32_size`.
* `fat32_seek`: Set current offset in file. Pass value in `fat32_size`. Values greater than the file size will set the pointer to the end of the file.

### Directory Entry Enumeration

* `fat32_open_dir`: Start enumerating dir. Pass path in `fat32_ptr` (or NULL for current).
* `fat32_read_dirent`: Enumerate next dir entry. Returns dir entry in struct `fat32_dirent`.
* `fat32_read_dirent_filtered`: Same as above, but uses filename filer. Pass filter in `fat32_ptr`.
* `fat32_find_dirent`: Read single dir entry. Pass path in `fat32_ptr`, returns dir entry in struct `fat32_dirent`.

### Directory Entry Manipulation

* `fat32_delete`: Delete file. Pass path in `fat32_ptr`.
* `fat32_rename`: Rename file. Pass old path in `fat32_ptr`, and new path in `fat32_ptr2`.
* `fat32_set_attribute`: Set file/directory attribute. Pass path in `fat32_ptr`.

### Subdirectories

* `fat32_chdir`: Change directory. Pass path in `fat32_ptr`.
* `fat32_mkdir`: Make subdirectory. Pass path in `fat32_ptr`.
* `fat32_rmdir`: Remove subdirectory. Pass path in `fat32_ptr`.

### Other

* `fat32_get_vollabel`: Get volume label. Returns label in `fat32_dirent::name`.
* `fat32_set_vollabel`: Set volume label. Pass in `fat32_ptr`.
* `fat32_get_free_space`: Get free space in KB. Returns value in `fat32_size`.
* `fat32_mkfs`: Create a new filesystem. Pass partition number in A, sectors per cluster in X (0: default), volume label in `fat32_ptr`, volume ID (4 bytes) in `fat32_ptr2` and OEM name (8 chars) in `fat32_bufptr`.
	* *Note*: With the default cluster size, the implementation trades off storage efficiency for read/write speed, i.e. it uses the largest possible cluster size, which wastes space, but reduces the number of FAT accesses during the use of the filesystem.

### Partition Table

* `fat32_get_ptable_entry`: Get partition table entry. Requires a context with no partition allocated (A = $FF). Pass partition number (0-3) in A. Returns name, type, start LBA and size in sectors in `fat32_dirent`.

### Callbacks

Some following functions need to be implemented in user code.

The FAT32 filesystem uses UCS-2 (16 bit Unicode) and CP437 (IBM PC encoding) internally, and calls the user to convert between these and the user's preferred 8 bit character encoding:

* `filename_char_ucs2_to_internal`: Convert UCS-2 character to private 8 bit encoding. Passes char in A:X, return char in A.
* `filename_char_internal_to_ucs2`: Convert character in private 8 bit encoding to UCS-2. Passes char in A, return char in X:A.
* `filename_cp437_to_internal`: Convert CP437 character to private 8 bit encoding. Passes char in A, return char in A.
* `filename_char_internal_to_cp437`: Convert character in private 8 bit encoding to CP437. Passes char in A, return char in A.

The library does not have any policy on filename matching (i.e. case sensitive/insensitive) or wildcard semantics. It calls the user to match names and file types:

* `match_name`: Decide whether a name of a file on disk matches a given name/mask. Passes name in `fat32_ptr` at offet Y, mask in `fat32_dirent`, return C=1 if matched.
* `match_type`: Decide whether a type of a file on disk matches an arbitrary filter. Passes type in A, return C=1 if matched.
