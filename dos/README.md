# CMDR-DOS: Commodore DOS on FAT32

**CMDR-DOS** is an open source 65c02 reimplementation of Commodore DOS, the OS and disk API of Commodore 8 bit disk drives (like the 1541). It works on FAT32 filesystems (32 MB to 2 TB) and supports CMD-style partitions, subdirectories, timestamps and filenames up to 255 characters. It is the DOS built into the [Commander X16](https://www.commanderx16.com).

This is the base features set compared to other Commodore DOS devices:

| Feature          | 1541 | 1571/1581 | CMD HD/FD | SD2IEC   | *CMDR-DOS*      |
|------------------|------|-----------|-----------|----------|-----------------|
| Sequential files | yes  | yes       | yes       | yes      | yes             |
| Relative files   | yes  | yes       | yes       | yes      | not yet         |
| Block access     | yes  | yes       | yes       | yes      | not yet         |
| Code execution   | yes  | yes       | yes       | no       | yes             |
| Burst commands   | no   | yes       | yes       | no       | no              |
| Timestamps       | no   | no        | yes       | yes      | yes             |
| Time API         | no   | no        | yes       | yes      | not yet         |
| Partitions       | no   | no        | yes       | yes      | yes             |
| Subdirectories   | no   | no        | yes       | yes      | yes             |

It consists of the following components:

* Commodore DOS interface
	* `main.s`: TALK/LISTEN dispatching
	* `parser.s`: filename/path parsing
	* `cmdch.s`: command channel parsing, status messages
	* `file.s`: file read/write
* FAT32 interface
	* `match.s`: FAT32 character set conversion, wildcard matching
	* `dir.s`: FAT32 directory listing
	* `function.s`: command implementations for FAT32
* FAT32 implementation
	* `fat32/*`: [FAT32 for 65c02 library](https://github.com/commanderx16/x16-rom/tree/master/dos/fat32)

CMDR-DOS implements the TALK/LISTEN layer (Commodore Peripheral Bus layer 3), it can therefore be directly hooked up to the Commodore IEEE KERNAL API (`talk`, `tksa`, `untlk`, `listn`, `secnd`, `unlsn`, `acptr`, `ciout`) and be used as a computer-based DOS, like on the C65 and the X16.

CMDR-DOS does not contain a layer 2 implementation, i.e. IEEE-488 (PET) or Commodore Serial (C64, C128, ...). By adding a Commodore Serial (aka "IEC") implementation, CMDR-DOS could be adapted for use as the system software of a standalone 65c02-based Serial device for Commodore computers, similar to an sd2iec device.

The Commodore DOS side and the FAT32 side are well separated, so a lot of code could be reused for a DOS that uses a different filesystem.

Or the core feature set, these are the supported functions:

* <sup>1</sup>: outdated API, not useful, or can't be supported on FAT32
* <sup>2</sup>: is a no-op, returns `00, OK,00,00`
* <sup>3</sup>: third argument `FAT32` *has* to be passed
* <sup>4</sup>: CMDR-DOS was architected to run on the main computer, so it shouldn't be DOS that keeps track of the time
* <sup>5</sup>: Instead of testing the ROM, this command currently verifies that no buffers are allocated, otherwise it halts. This is used by unit tests to detect leaks.

The following added commands and features are specific to CMDR-DOS:

| Feature               | Syntax      | Description                                                                    |
|-----------------------|-------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Open for Read & Write | `,?,M`      | Allows arbitrarily reading, writing and setting the position (`P`)<sup>1</sup> |
| POSITION              | `P` _channel_ _p0_ _p1_ _p2_ _p3_  | Set position within file (like sd2iec); all args binary |

* <sup>1</sup>: once the EOF has been reached while reading, no further reads or writes are possible.

All currently unsupported commands are decoded in `cmdch.s` anyway, but hooked into `31,SYNTAX ERROR,00,00`, so adding features should be as easy as adding the implementation.
