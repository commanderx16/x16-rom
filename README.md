Commander X16 BASIC/KERNAL/DOS/GEOS ROM
=======================================

This is the Commander X16 ROM containing BASIC, KERNAL, DOS and GEOS. BASIC and KERNAL are derived from the [Commodore 64 versions](https://github.com/mist64/c64rom). GEOS is derived from the [C64/C128 version](https://github.com/mist64/geos).

* BASIC is fully compatible with Commodore BASIC V2.
* KERNAL
	* supports the complete $FF81+ API.
	* has the same zero page and $0200-$033C memory layout as the C64.
	* does not support tape (device 1).
* GEOS is fully compatible with the C64 version.


Releases and Building
---------------------

<a href="https://travis-ci.org/commanderx16/x16-emulator"><img alt="Travis (.org)" src="https://img.shields.io/travis/commanderx16/x16-rom.svg?label=CI&logo=travis&logoColor=white&style=for-the-badge"></a>

Each [release of the X16 emulator][emu-releases] includes a compatible build of `rom.bin`. If you wish to build this yourself (perhaps because you're also building the emulator) see below.

> __WARNING:__ The emulator will currently work only with a contemporary version of `rom.bin`; earlier or later versions are likely to fail.

### Building the ROM

Building this source code requires only [GNU Make] and the [cc65] assembler. GNU Make is almost invariably available as a system package with any Linux distribution; cc65 less often so. 

- Red Hat/CentOS: `sudo yum install make cc65` 
- Debian: `sudo apt-get install make`

On macOS, cc65 in [homebrew](https://brew.sh/), which must be installed before issuing the following command:

- macOS: `brew install cc65`

If cc65 is not available as a package on your system, you'll need to install or build/install it per the instructions below.

Once the prerequisites are available, type `make` to build `rom.bin`. To use that with the emulator, copy it to the same directory as the `x16emu` binary or use `x16emu -rom .../path/to/rom.bin`.

*Additional Notes: For users of Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8, you will need to have CodeReady builder repositories enabled, for CentOS, this is called PowerTools. Additionally, you will need Fedora EPEL installed as well as cc65 does not come usually within the official repositories.*

### Building/Installing cc65

#### Linux Builds from Source

You'll need the basic set of tools for building C programs:
- Debian/Ubuntu: `sudo apt-get install build-essential git`

The cc65 source is [on GitHub][cc65]; clone and build it with:

    git clone https://github.com/cc65/cc65.git
    make -j4    # -j4 may be left off; it merely speeds the build

This will leave the binaries in the `bin/` subdirectory; you may use thes directly by adding them to your path, or install them to a standard directory:

    #   This assumes you have ~/.local/bin in your path.
    make install PREFIX=~/.local

#### Building and Packages for Other Systems

Consult the Nesdev Wiki [Installing CC65][nd-cc65] page for some hints, including Windows installs. However, the Debian packages they suggest from [trikaliotis.net] appear to have signature errors.


New Features
------------

* F-keys:
	F1: `LIST`
	F2: `MONITOR`
	F3: `RUN`
	F4: &lt;switch 40/80&gt;
	F5: `LOAD`
	F6: `SAVE"`
	F7: `DOS"$`
	F8: `DOS`
* New BASIC instructions
	* `MONITOR`: see below.
	* `DOS`:
	no argument: read disk status.
	"8" or "9" as an argument: switch default drive.
	"$" as an argument: show directory.
	all other arguments: send DOS command
	* `VPEEK`(bank, offset), `VPOKE` bank, offset, value to access video memory. "offset" is 16 bits, "bank" is bits 16-19 of the linear address.
	Note that the tokens for the new BASIC commands have not been finalized yet, so loading a BASIC program that uses the new keywords in a future version of the ROM will break!
* Support for `$` and `%` in BASIC expressions for hex and binary
* `LOAD` prints the start and end(+1) addresses
* Integrated Monitor derived from the [Final Cartridge III](https://github.com/mist64/final_cartridge).
	* `O00`..`OFF` to switch ROM and RAM banks
	* `OV0`..`OV4` to switch to video address space
* FAT32-formatted SD card as drive 8 as a full IEC (TALK/LISTEN & CBM DOS) compatible device:
	* read directory
	* load file
	* send "I" command
	* read status
	* everything else is unimplemented
* Some new KERNAL APIs (to be documented)


Big TODOs
---------

* DOS needs more features.
* BASIC needs more features.
* IEC is not working.
* PS/2 and SD have issues on real hardware.
