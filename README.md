Commander X16 BASIC/KERNAL/DOS/GEOS ROM
=======================================

This is the Commander X16 ROM containing BASIC, KERNAL, DOS and GEOS. BASIC and KERNAL are derived from the [Commodore 64 versions](https://github.com/mist64/c64rom). GEOS is derived from the [C64/C128 version](https://github.com/mist64/geos).

* BASIC is fully compatible with Commodore BASIC V2.
* KERNAL
	* supports the complete $FF81+ API.
	* has the same zero page and $0200-$033C memory layout as the C64.
	* does not support tape (device 1).
* GEOS is fully compatible with the C64 version.


Releases and Building
---------------------

Each [release of the X16 emulator][emu-releases] includes a compatible build of `rom.bin`. If you wish to build this yourself (perhaps because you're also building the emulator) see below.

> __WARNING:__ The emulator will currently work only with a contemporary version of `rom.bin`; earlier or later versions are likely to fail.

### Building the ROM

Building this source code requires only [GNU Make] and the [cc65] assembler. GNU Make is almost invariably available as a system package with any Linux distribution; cc65 less often so. 

- Red Hat: `sudo yum install make cc65`
- Debian: `sudo apt-get install make`

On macOS, cc65 in [homebrew](https://brew.sh/), which must be installed before issuing the following command:

- macOS: `brew install cc65`

If cc65 is not available as a package on your system, you'll need to install or build/install it per the instructions below.

Once the prerequisites are available, type `make` to build `rom.bin`. To use that with the emulator, copy it to the same directory as the `x16emu` binary or use `x16emu -rom .../path/to/rom.bin`.

### Building/Installing cc65

#### Linux Builds from Source

You'll need the basic set of tools for building C programs:
- Debian/Ubuntu: `sudo apt-get install build-essential git`

The cc65 source is [on GitHub][cc65]; clone and build it with:

    git clone https://github.com/cc65/cc65.git
    make -j4    # -j4 may be left off; it merely speeds the build

This will leave the binaries in the `bin/` subdirectory; you may use thes directly by adding them to your path, or install them to a standard directory:

    #   This assumes you have ~/.local/bin in your path.
    make install PREFIX=~/.local

#### Building and Packages for Other Systems

Consult the Nesdev Wiki [Installing CC65][nd-cc65] page for some hints, including Windows installs. However, the Debian packages they suggest from [trikaliotis.net] appear to have signature errors.


New Features
------------

* F-keys:
	F1: `LIST`
	F2: `MONITOR`
	F3: `RUN`
	F4: &lt;switch 40/80&gt;
	F5: `LOAD`
	F6: `SAVE"`
	F7: `DOS"$`
	F8: `DOS`
* New BASIC instructions
	* `MONITOR`: see below.
	* `DOS`:
	no argument: read disk status.
	"8" or "9" as an argument: switch default drive.
	"$" as an argument: show directory.
	all other arguments: send DOS command
	* `VPEEK`(bank, offset), `VPOKE` bank, offset, value to access video memory. "offset" is 16 bits, "bank" is bits 16-19 of the linear address.
	Note that the tokens for the new BASIC commands have not been finalized yet, so loading a BASIC program that uses the new keywords in a future version of the ROM will break!
* Support for `$` and `%` in BASIC expressions for hex and binary
* `LOAD` prints the start and end(+1) addresses
* Integrated Monitor derived from the [Final Cartridge III](https://github.com/mist64/final_cartridge).
	* `O00`..`OFF` to switch ROM and RAM banks
	* `OV0`..`OV4` to switch to video address space
* FAT32-formatted SD card as drive 8 as a full IEC (TALK/LISTEN & CBM DOS) compatible device:
	* read directory
	* load file
	* send "I" command
	* read status
	* everything else is unimplemented
* Some new KERNAL APIs (to be documented)


Big TODOs
---------

* DOS needs more features.
* BASIC needs more features.
* RS232 and IEC are not working.
* PS/2 and SD have issues on real hardware.

RAM Map
-------

* fixed RAM:
	* $0000-$0400 KERNAL/BASIC/DOS system variables
	* $0400-$0800 currently unused
	* $0800-$9F00 BASIC RAM
* banked RAM:
	* banks 0-254: free for applications
	* bank 255: DOS buffers and variables
