Commander X16 BASIC/KERNAL/DOS/GEOS ROM
=======================================

This is the Commander X16 ROM containing BASIC, KERNAL, DOS and GEOS. BASIC and KERNAL are derived from the [Commodore 64 versions](https://github.com/mist64/c64rom). GEOS is derived from the [C64/C128 version](https://github.com/mist64/geos).

* BASIC is fully compatible with Commodore BASIC V2, with some additions.
* KERNAL
	* supports the complete $FF81+ API.
	* adds lots of new API, including joystick, mouse and bitmap graphics.
	* supports the same $0300-$0332 vectors as the C64.
	* does not support tape (device 1) or software RS-232 (device 2).
* GEOS is fully compatible with the C64 version.
* DOS
	* is compatible with Commodore DOS (`$`, `SCRATCH`, `NEW`, ...).
	* works on SD cards with FAT32 filesystems.
	* supports long filenames, timestamps.
	* supports partitions and subdirectories (CMD-style).
* CodeX Interactive Assembly Environment
   * edit assembly code in RAM
   * save program, and debug information
   * run and debug assembly programs


Releases and Building
---------------------

<a href="https://travis-ci.org/commanderx16/x16-emulator"><img alt="Travis (.org)" src="https://img.shields.io/travis/commanderx16/x16-rom.svg?label=CI&logo=travis&logoColor=white&style=for-the-badge"></a>

Each [release of the X16 emulator][emu-releases] includes a compatible build of `rom.bin`. If you wish to build this yourself (perhaps because you're also building the emulator) see below.

> __WARNING:__ The emulator will currently work only with a contemporary version of `rom.bin`; earlier or later versions are likely to fail.

### Building the ROM

Building this source code requires only [GNU Make] and the [cc65] assembler. GNU Make is almost invariably available as a system package with any Linux distribution; cc65 less often so. 

- Red Hat/CentOS: `sudo yum install make cc65` 
- Debian/Ubuntu: `sudo apt-get install make cc65`

On macOS, cc65 in [homebrew](https://brew.sh/), which must be installed before issuing the following command:

- macOS: `brew install cc65`

If cc65 is not available as a package on your system, you'll need to install or build/install it per the instructions below.

Once the prerequisites are available, type `make` to build `rom.bin`. To use that with the emulator, copy it to the same directory as the `x16emu` binary or use `x16emu -rom .../path/to/rom.bin`.

*Additional Notes: For users of Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8, you will need to have CodeReady builder repositories enabled, for CentOS, this is called PowerTools. Additionally, you will need Fedora EPEL installed as well as cc65 does not come usually within the official repositories.*

### Building/Installing cc65

#### Linux Builds from Source

You'll need the basic set of tools for building C programs:
- Debian/Ubuntu: `sudo apt-get install build-essential git`

The cc65 source is [on GitHub][cc65]; clone and build it with:

    git clone https://github.com/cc65/cc65.git
    make -j4    # -j4 may be left off; it merely speeds the build

This will leave the binaries in the `bin/` subdirectory; you may use thes directly by adding them to your path, or install them to a standard directory:

    #   This assumes you have ~/.local/bin in your path.
    make install PREFIX=~/.local

#### Building and Packages for Other Systems

Consult the Nesdev Wiki [Installing CC65][nd-cc65] page for some hints, including Windows installs. However, the Debian packages they suggest from [trikaliotis.net] appear to have signature errors.
